Corner detector on OpenCV

Corner detectors

If you think of edges as being lines, then corners are an obvious choice for features as they represent the intersection of two lines. 
One of the earlier corner detectors was introduced by Harris, and it is still a very effective corner detector that gets used quite a lot: it's reliable and it's fast. 
There's a tutorial explaining how Harris works on the OpenCV site
